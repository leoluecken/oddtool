TODOs (also check for XXX, FIXME, TODO inside code):

- allow inline comments in parameters.txt

- rename system_name_temp/continuation_*.txt into system_name_continuation_data/history_*.txt for simpler continuation workflow

- verbosity control is messed up, because it didn't work -- clean up

- discuss stack pre-allocation (instead of heap) for SwapVectorStorage

- test, test, test

- allow control of the density of output values 
  (e.g. equidistant at output_grid)

- assure that SwapVectorStorage::data.size() >= 3

- handle situation without provided history for derivatives, i.e.,
- in Hermite interpolation: if no stored data for the rhs is provided, try something else (Newton interpolation?)

- Optimize interpolation by narrowing ranges simultaneously
- Optimize subsequent interpolation calls with similar t_query (during RK)

- compare performance to matlab dde23
